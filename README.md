## Motivation

The project started because of a common usecase for an endpoint (HTTP) to ingest data, where the user on the client side expects to receive a delivery confirmation that the message has been received, yet the response itself doens't matter.

</p>

On a company that I used to work for, that was the case for the entry point of leads, the source of ðŸ’°. As the image above shows, both the **database writes** and **mailing** were triggered on time of the request. We'll have seen that, is a pretty common pattern.

The problem is that scaling it creates all sorts of issues, mostly unnecessary ones. People try to scale the database to handle the back-pressure, which even if you have to do it, you don't want to depend entirely on a database write to handle enormous data ingestion.

Also, you probably handle different loads during the day, or time of the year, which would make you pay for a database on the worst-case-scenario but only make use of it during the spikes.

e.g.:

Request:
```
POST /leads HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Content-Length: 327
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_1) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/12.0.1 Safari/605.1.15

{"message":"this is a lead message", "shop": "a23m07b23"}
```

Response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Connection: keep-alive
Date: Sun, 09 Dec 2018 11:07:54 GMT
Content-Encoding: gzip
Transfer-Encoding: Identity

{"status": "OK"}
```

The whole point is to have a **high available** endpoint to avoid package loss, disregarding the processing. If you need to return something to the user on the time of the request, it's probably not for you.

Which is a quite common pattern for data-ingestion in general: statistics, events, tracking, order-placement, queue items, ...

### Use cases
> Some usecases

You can use crowd to handle back-pressure on existing endpoints and scale your current REST APIs.

</p>

Or even as an entrypoint to your stream/queues with multiple consumers of the data:
